- User-based Collaborative Filtering (UB - CF)
Imagine that we want to recommend a book to our friend My Tue. We would assume that similar
people will have similar taste. That means if I and Tue have read many same books, and we rated
them almost identically. I already read "Mat Ngot Chet Meo" by Meo Mun Den and gave this book
high rating, but she didn't ==> Very maybe likely probably possibly, she would love the book too ==> Recommend it
to her ==> We used User-based Collaborative Filtering

- Item-based Collaborative Filtering (IB - CF)
Each book will have its author, category, published year, publishing company, etc etc. Instead of
focusing on me (similar users), we will focus on the features of the items to decide - Would Tue
like it or not?
We could divide IB-CF into 2 sub-tasks:
	1) Calculate similarity among the items by using Cosine-based Similarity
	2) Calculation of Prediction by using either Weighted Sum or Regression
